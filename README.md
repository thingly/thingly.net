# thingly

## Getting Started
You'll need a virtual environment with dependencies installed:

```shell
python3 -mvenv venv --prompt thingly
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

You can then start up a development server using:

```shell
flask --app thingly --debug run
```
